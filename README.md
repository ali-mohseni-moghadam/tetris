## Project Overview

This project is a web-based Tetris game. The game logic and rendering are handled by Babylon.js, a powerful 3D engine. The T3 stack provides a robust foundation for building and managing the game's backend and frontend

interfaces. Tailwind CSS and ShadCN are used for styling, while TRPC and React Query manage data fetching and state synchronization.

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay with intuitive controls.
- Real-time updates and synchronization using TRPC.
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN.
- Modern, maintainable codebase with Next.js.
- High-performance rendering with Babylon.js.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **ShadCN**: Component library for building modern web applications.
- **TRPC**: Type-safe APIs using TypeScript.
- **React Query**: Powerful data-fetching and state management library for React.
- **Babylon.js**: 3D engine for graphics rendering and game logic.
